# MetaTrader5 Integration Client

This project provides a user-friendly integration with MetaTrader5, utilizing the existing MetaTrader5 library. It is designed to simplify interacting with MetaTrader5, making it more accessible and easier to use. It only has access to client-side processes, meaning that fee swapping and similar broker-side operations are not supported. A fully integrated API is in development.
